  abstract = {Optimal microgrid design is a challenging problem, especially for multi-energy microgrids with electricity, heating, and cooling loads as well as sources, and multiple energy carriers. To address this problem, this paper presents an optimization model formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, which determines the optimal technology portfolio, the optimal technology placement, and the associated optimal dispatch, in a microgrid with multiple energy types. The developed model uses a multi-node modeling approach (as opposed to an aggregate single-node approach) that includes electrical power flow and heat flow equations, and hence, offers the ability to perform optimal siting considering physical and operational constraints of electrical and heating/cooling networks. The new model is founded on the existing optimization model DER-CAM, a state-of-the-art decision support tool for microgrid planning and design. The results of a case study that compares single-node vs. multi-node optimal design for an example microgrid show the importance of multi-node modeling. It has been shown that single-node approaches are not only incapable of optimal DER placement, but may also result in sub-optimal DER portfolio, as well as underestimation of investment costs.},

  abstract = {Microgrids are energy systems that aggregate distributed energy resources, loads, and power electronics devices in a stable and balanced way. They rely on energy management systems to schedule optimally the distributed energy resources. Conventionally, many scheduling problems have been solved by using complex algorithms that, even so, do not consider the operation of the distributed energy resources. This paper presents the modeling and design of a modular energy management system and its integration to a grid-connected battery-based microgrid. The scheduling model is a power generation-side strategy, defined as a general mixed-integer linear programming by taking into account two stages for proper charging of the storage units. This model is considered as a deterministic problem that aims to minimize operating costs and promote self-consumption based on 24-hour ahead forecast data. The operation of the microgrid is complemented with a supervisory control stage that compensates any mismatch between the offline scheduling process and the real time microgrid operation. The proposal has been tested experimentally in a hybrid microgrid at the Microgrid Research Laboratory, Aalborg University.},

In this paper, we present a study on applying a model predictive control approach to the problem of efficiently optimizing microgrid operations while satisfying a time-varying request and operation constraints. The overall problem is formulated using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), which can be solved in an efficient way by using commercial solvers without resorting to complex heuristics or decompositions techniques. Then, the MILP formulation leads to significant improvements in solution quality and computational burden. A case study of a microgrid is employed to assess the performance of the online optimization-based control strategy and the simulation results are discussed.

  abstract = {We present two Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models for a complete microgrid planning problem which consider uncertainties in the main input data (hourly solar irradiance, wind speed and electricity demand). The first model adopts a Two-Stage Stochastic Integer Programming (2SSIP) formulation with discrete scenarios, whereas the second model adopts a Robust Optimization (RO) formulation with polyhedral uncertainty sets. The aim is to determine the optimal combination, capacities, and number of components to install in the microgrid considering long-term operations and uncertainty in the main input data. The 2SSIP model offers the possibility to obtain a planning solution using discrete scenarios sampled from appropriate probability distributions. The RO model gives a planning solution which is guaranteed to be feasible for any realization of input data within specified uncertainty sets. To show and compare the effectiveness of these models, we present a case study in which we apply the two models to plan a standalone microgrid in Singida, Tanzania. The proposed models can be applied for planning and detailed feasibility studies on generic microgrids with renewables, storage batteries and diesel generators.},

This paper is focused on the problem of optimally sizing, from an economic perspective, the Distributed Energy Resources included in a DC Microgrid, determining the optimal mix of Distributed Generators and Energy Storage Systems, taking also into account the opportunities of Load Management. The proposed procedure is based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming and allows to determine the optimal sizes of Distributed Energy Resources which minimize the Microgrid Total Cost of Ownership, given location and load characteristics. The procedure is formulated as a quite general method that can be used for different microgrid architectures and different generation and storage technologies, although in this paper it is applied to a grid-connected DC microgrid with PV generation and storage system.

  doi = {10.1109/ISGTEurope.2016.7856285},
  abstract = {This paper addresses the residential energy cost optimization problem in smart grid. More precisely, it proposes an approximate optimization model and evaluates its performance with an exact model. Previously, we developed an exact model which considers energy trading between the households in the microgrid. In the proposed approach, all households determine the microgrid energy price and quantity in collaboration with others. The complexity of the model was further increased when the unfair cost distribution problem among the households was addressed. The final model is a multi-objective non-convex Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem. Its complexity is NP-hard which means that using the resulting solution is not practical because the solution times increase exponentially according to the increase in the problem size. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes an approximate model by using bi-linear optimization to reduce the computational complexity. The bilinear model breaks down the MINLP model into multiple Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) modules and iteratively solves these modules until it meets the terminating criterion. Results show that solution times of the bi-linear model are very low compared to the exact model. Moreover, 97\% of the solutions generated by the bi-linear model are optimal solutions. The proposed model maintains Pareto optimality which means that no households will be worse off to improve the cost of others. The final solution minimizes the total cost of the households in the microgrid.},

Short-term optimal dispatch is based on minimizing the adjustment of the day-ahead scheduling and giving priority to the use of renewable energy.

  abstract = {Energy management system (EMS) is responsible for the optimal operation of microgrids. EMS adjusts its operational schedule for near future by using the available information. Market price signals are generally used for the operation of microgrids, which are obtained by using estimation/ forecasting methods. However, it is difficult to precisely predict the market prices due to the involvement of various complex factors like weather, policy, demand, errors in forecasting methods, and fuel cost. Therefore, in this paper, the uncertainties associated with the real-time market price signals (buying and selling) are realized via a robust optimization method. In addition to market price signals, uncertainties associated with renewable power sources and forecasted load values are also considered. Initially, a deterministic model is formulated for an ac/dc hybrid microgrid. Then a min-max robust counterpart is formulated by considering the worstcase uncertainties. Finally, an equivalent mixed integer problem is formulated by using linear duality and other optimality conditions. The developed model can provide feasible solutions for all the scenarios if the uncertainties fluctuate within the specified bounds. The effect of market price uncertainties on internal power transfer and external power trading, operation cost, the state-of-charge of energy storage elements, and unit commitment of dispatchable generators is analyzed. Taguchi's orthogonal array (OA) method is used to find the worst-case scenario within the specified uncertainty bounds. Then, Monte Carlo method is used to generate various scenarios within the uncertainty bounds to evaluate the robustness of the selected scenario via Taguchi's OA method. Finally, a violation index is formulated to evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach against the deterministic model. Simulations results have validated the robustness of the proposed optimization strategy.},

  abstract = {Energy supply in rural and off-grid communities has traditionally relied on diesel-based microgrids, due to limited access. But global environmental concerns are pushing for the transformation of these systems into renewable-based microgrids. This transition to more complex systems with a mix of dispatchable and nondispatchable resources requires new planning tools that ensure the security of supply. This paper presents a novel mixed-integer linear optimization model that determines optimal technology mix, size, placement, and associated dispatch for a multi-energy microgrid. The model satisfies microgrid's electrical and heat transfer network limitations by integrating linear power flow and heat transfer equations. It captures the efficiency gains from waste heat recovery through combined heat and power technologies, by modeling the interplay between electrical and heat sources. To ensure a secure design against generator outages, the optimization maintains sufficient reserve capacity in the system, which is dynamically allocated based on system operating conditions. Several case studies on an isolated microgrid model, developed based on a real microgrid in Alaska, illustrate how the proposed model works. The results show the effectiveness of the model and are used to discuss various aspects of the optimization solution.},

With the proposed scheme, the renewable energy penetration ratio achieves 50\%, which is acceptable. Moreover, the curtailed renewable energy ratio of 1.22\% is obtained, which is very low.

The model takes into account the intrinsic stochastic behavior of renewable energy and the uncertainty involving electric load prediction, and thus proper stochastic models are considered. This paper investigates the effect of load flexibility on the component sizing of the system for a residential microgrid in Okinawa.

Unfortunately, the deployment of distributed algorithms across micro grids have been overlooked in the electric grid sector. In particular, centralized methods for managing resources and data may not be sufficient to monitor a complex electric grid. This paper discusses a decentralized constrained decomposition using Linear Programming (LP) that optimizes the inter-area transfer across micro grids that reduces total generation cost for the grid.

In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient near optimal control approach to tackle this problem. Specifically, a new islanded microgrid model, including the power supply and demand as well as battery lifetime characteristics, has been formulated based on Markov decision process. Then, we propose an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach to solve this energy optimization problem, and achieve near minimum operational cost efficiently. We use linear programming (LP) and dynamic programming (DP) approaches to validate the percentage of optimality of our proposed approach for deterministic and stochastic case studies, respectively. Our proposed approach can obtain 100\% optimality in deterministic cases comparing with results from LP, and can obtain competitive percentages of optimality with around 50\% less computational time in stochastic cases comparing with results from DP. Moreover, we quantify that discharging the BESS at a certain state of charge (SOC) range can increase the battery lifetime and the yearly net savings of the system. In addition, we validate our proposed approach for different sets of large data samples and achieve 18:69 times faster response than that of the traditional DP approach for 0:5 million of data samples.},

It shows how energy conversion units such as a cogeneration fuel cell, a heat pump, a boiler, photovoltaic panels and solar thermal collectors can be combined with energy storage devices, consisting of a battery and a hot water tank, to drive down total yearly energy costs and CO2 emissions while meeting space heat, hot water and electricity needs.

Stochastic programming is used effectively to reduce the sensitivity to uncertainty in weather parameters. The resulting cost increase is limited to 1.2\%. Decision rules are implemented to account for unforeseen variations in electric load.

Nevertheless, they produce uncertainties as well. To accommodate the combined uncertainties, a two-stage robust model predictive control based optimization approach is proposed in this paper. The mixed integer quadratic programming model is established in the first operation stage to minimize the operation cost under the joint worst case of uncertainty, then an economic dispatch model is used to minimize the adjustment cost after obtaining actual data in the second operation stage. Robust linearization methods with the consideration of three types of uncertainty scenarios and uncertainty budgets are utilized in the first operation stage.

This results in a bi-level optimization problem, where choice of the parameterization scheme is made at the upper level while system operation decisions are made at the lower level. The p-MILP formulation leads to significant improvements in uncertainty management, solution quality and computational burden; by easing dependency on meteorological information and avoiding the multiple computational cycles of the traditional online optimization techniques. The problem is solved offline on a day-ahead basis, allowing online implementation to be achieved via real-time system state updates.

  abstract = {This work presents a generic optimization framework to address the problem of the optimal design and operational scheduling of energy microgrids. The problem to be solved is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model whose objective function concerns the total cost minimization of the energy microgrid. The energy generating units to be installed consist of technologies using fuel (natural gas) as a raw material (microturbines, fuel cells etc.), and renewable energy sources (wind and solar). The microgrid is divided into a certain number of zones, each of which is characterized by a given amount of electricity demand to be satisfied, while the system can exchange electrical energy with the main power grid by acquiring from and selling energy to the grid. The efficiency and applicability of the proposed model is illustrated using three case studies. The maximum allowable level of CO2 emissions, the price of electricity purchased from the main grid, and the price of electricity sold to the main grid constitute the parameters whose influences on the economic variables of the microgrid, on the quantities and the capacities of the installed technologies, as well as on the energy balance of the microgrid are investigated. The proposed model provides a systematic and analytical methodological framework for a detailed planning and scheduling of energy microgrids, highlighting potential risks and appropriate price signals on critical energy projects undertaken by investors and/or designed by policy makers at a national and/or regional level under realistic operating conditions.},

  abstract = {Energy Management System (EMS) applications of modern power networks like microgrids have to respond to a number of stringent challenges due to current energy revolution. Optimal resource dispatch tasks must be handled with specific regard to the addition of new resource types and the adoption of novel modeling considerations. In addition, due to the comprehensive changes concerning the multi cell grid structure, new policies should be fulfilled via microgrids' EMS. At the same time achieving a variety of (conflicting) goals in different microgrids requires a universal and a multi criteria optimization tool. Few of recent works in this area have considered the different perspectives of network operation with high amount of constraints and decision criteria. In this paper two dispatch-optimizers for a centralized EMS (CEMS) as a universal tool are introduced. An improved real-coded genetic algorithm and an enhanced mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based method have been developed to schedule the unit commitment and economic dispatch of microgrid units. In the proposed methods, network restrictions like voltages and equipment loadings and unit constraints have been considered. The adopted genetic algorithm features a highly flexible set of sub-functions, intelligent convergence behavior, as well as diversified searching approaches and penalty methods for constraint violations. Moreover, a novel method has been introduced to deal with the limitations of the MILP algorithm for handling the non-linear network topology constraints. A new aging model of a Lithium-Ion battery based on an event-driven aging behavior has been introduced. Ultimately, the developed GA-based and MILP-based optimizers have been applied to a test microgrid model under different operation policies, and the functionality of each method has been evaluated and compared together.},

  abstract = {Hybrid microgrids that use renewable energy sources can improve energy security and islanding time while reducing costs. One potential beneficiary of these systems is the U.S. military, which can seek to improve energy security when operating in isolated areas by using a microgrid rather than relying on a fragile (or nonexistent) commercial network. Renewable energy sources can be intermittent and unpredictable, making it difficult to plan operations of a microgrid. We describe a scenario-robust mixed-integer linear program designed to utilize ensemble weather forecasts to improve the performance of a hybrid microgrid containing both renewable and traditional power sources. We exercise our model to quantify the benefit of using ensemble weather forecasts, and we predict the optimal performance of a hypothetical grid containing wind turbines by using simulated realistic weather forecast scenarios based on data. Because forecast quality degrades with lead time, we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine which planning horizon results in the best performance. Our results show that, for day-ahead planning, longer planning horizons outperform shorter planning horizons in terms of cost of operations, but this improvement diminishes as the planning horizon lengthens.},

  abstract = {Microgrids are indispensable components of active energy systems that supply diverse electrical and thermal demands. A microgrid is composed of distributed energy resources (DER) including renewable resources, combined heat and power generation (CHP) and conventional generation resources that rely on fossil fuels. Energy hubs in microgrids facilitate the conversion of different types of energy resources. The coupling among natural gas and electricity distribution networks introduces new challenges to the short-term operation planning of microgrids. In this paper, a two-stage stochastic optimization problem is formulated for the short-term operation planning of microgrids with multiple-energy carrier networks to determine the scheduled energy and reserve capacity. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem in which the objective function is to minimize the expected operation cost in the short-term operation horizon. The uncertainties in the renewable generation including the wind and solar photovoltaic generation, and electrical and thermal demands are captured by introducing scenarios with respective probabilities. The proposed solution framework ensures the reliability and security of energy supply in multiple scenarios. The advantage of capturing the interdependence among the electricity and natural gas systems to promote energy efficiency is presented. Furthermore, the effectiveness of demand response programs to reduce the operation costs and improve the security measures is investigated. The sensitivity of the operation costs to the variation of natural gas flow and congestion in pipelines and energy prices is addressed to highlight the interdependence among natural gas and electricity infrastructure systems.},

  abstract = {This paper aims at enhancing the resilience of a photovoltaic-based microgrid equipped with battery storage, supplying a typical commercial building. When extreme weather conditions such as hurricane, tsunami and similar events occur, leading to islanding of the microgrid from the main power grid, it is not expected that the microgrid would be taken out of service for a long time. At the same time, it is not cost effective to make the electrical system to be absolutely reliable to provide service for the customers. The main contribution of this paper lies in its ability to determine the optimal point between the operational cost and grid resilience. In other words, this work proposes an optimal management system of battery energy storage in a way to enhance the resilience of the proposed microgrid while maintaining its operational cost at a minimum level. The optimization is achieved by solving a linear optimization programming problem while the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is incorporated in the objective function. The CVaR is used to account for the uncertainty in the intermittent PV system generated power and that in the electricity price. Simulation analyses are carried out in MATLAB to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results reveal that the commercial building microgrid resilience is improved remarkably at a slight increase in the operational cost.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a linear battery aging and degradation model to a multi-energy microgrid sizing model using mixed integer linear programming. The battery aging model and its integration into a larger microgrid sizing formulation are described. A case study is provided to explore the impact of considering battery aging on key results: optimal photovoltaic and storage capacities, optimal distributed energy resources operations strategies, and annual cost and generation metrics. The case study results suggest that considering battery degradation in optimal microgrid sizing problems significantly impacts the perceived value of storage. Depending on capacity loss and lifetime targets, considering battery degradation is shown to decrease optimal storage capacities between 6 and 92\% versus scenarios that do not consider battery health. When imposing constant distributed energy resource capacities, inclusion of degradation can decrease optimal annual battery cycling by as much as a factor five and reduce total annual electricity cost savings from otherwise identical photovoltaic and storage systems by 5\textendash{}12\%. These results emphasize that as batteries grow in maturity and ubiquity for distributed energy applications, considering battery health and capacity loss is an essential component of any analytical tool or model to guide system planning and decision-making.},

  abstract = {As an alternative to current centralised energy generation systems, microgrids are adopted to provide local energy with lower energy expenses and gas emissions by utilising distributed energy resources (DER). Several micro combined heat and power technologies have been developed recently for applications at domestic scale. The optimal design of DERs within CHP-based microgrids plays an important role in promoting the penetration of microgrid systems. In this work, the optimal design of microgrids with CHP units is addressed by coupling environmental and economic sustainability in a multi-objective optimisation model which integrates the results of a life cycle assessment of the microgrids investigated. The results show that the installation of multiple CHP technologies has a lower cost with higher environmental saving compared with the case when only a single technology is installed in each site, meaning that the microgrid works in a more efficient way when multiple technologies are selected. In general, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells are chosen as the basic CHP technology for most solutions, which offers lower environmental impacts at low cost. However, internal combustions engines (ICE) and Stirling engines (SE) are preferred if the heat demand is high.},

  abstract = {We present a parametric programming based approach for energy management in microgrids. An operational planning problem for a grid-connected microgrid with energy sources including solar photovoltaic, wind turbine and battery energy storage system, in addition to a household load demand, is captured as a parametric mixed-integer linear programming problem (p-MILP) through parameterizations of the uncertain coordinates of wind and solar energy resources. Thus, the energy management problem - typically nonlinear - is transformed into a linear bi-level optimization problem, where choice of the parameterization scheme is made at the upper level while system operation decisions are made at the lower level. The p-MILP formulation leads to significant improvements in uncertainty handling, solution quality and computational ease; by removing dependency of the solution on meteorological forecasts and avoiding the multiple computational cycles of the traditional online optimization techniques. The problem is solved offline on a flexible time-scale basis, allowing online implementation to be achievable on real-time system state updates. The proposed parametric programming approach extends the state-of-the-art in microgrid energy management methods and the results from various case studies are used to demonstrate the feasibility of our method.},
